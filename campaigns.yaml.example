# Foothold Checkpoint Tool - Example Campaigns Configuration
#
# Copy this file to ~/.foothold-checkpoint/campaigns.yaml and customize for your setup.
#
# This file defines all campaign configurations including file names for each campaign.
# This file can be shared between CLI and DCSServerBot plugin to maintain DRY principle.
#
# Each campaign defines all known file names for each file type:
#   - persistence: Main Lua file(s) - REQUIRED (at least one file)
#   - ctld_save: CTLD save CSV file(s) - optional
#   - ctld_farps: CTLD FARPs CSV file(s) - optional  
#   - storage: Storage CSV file(s) - optional
#
# Campaign File Naming Evolution:
# When a campaign's file names change over time, list ALL accepted names for each file.
# The FIRST name in the list is the "canonical" (current) name:
#   - On restore: old checkpoint files are automatically renamed to the first (canonical) name
#   - On save: files matching any name in the list will be included
#
# Optional Files:
# Mark file types as optional with `optional: true`. The tool will skip them if not present
# without generating warnings. Required file types (like persistence) must have at least one file.
